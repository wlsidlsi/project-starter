# High-Level Requirements Gathering

## 1. Project Overview
- What is the primary business objective?
- Who are the key stakeholders and end users?
- What are the success criteria or KPIs?
- What is the project’s timeline?

## 2. Architecture Choices

- Decide whether to adopt a Zero Trust model.
- Evaluate identity-centric access control (per-user/per-device auth).
- Decide on network segmentation strategies.
- Plan for micro-segmentation and policy enforcement points.

### 2.1 Microservices vs. Monolith
- What are the core services or functionalities that might be separated or combined?
- Are there clear domain boundaries or shared domains among different modules?
- How will independent deployment and scaling of components impact the project’s goals?
- Is the organization prepared for the operational complexity of microservices?

### 2.2 Serverless (Functions) vs. Compute (VM/Containers)
- What is the expected workload and usage pattern (steady or bursty)?
- How do operational maintenance and patching requirements factor into the decision?
- What latency or performance requirements must be met?
- Is the team comfortable with event-driven paradigms and function-based architectures?

### 2.3 Single-Region vs. Multi-Region Redundancy
- What level of uptime or availability is required by SLAs?
- Is disaster recovery a critical factor, and how quickly must the system recover?
- What data residency or compliance regulations need to be considered?
- Are budgets sufficient to handle multi-region costs?

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- What performance metrics (throughput, response time) are needed?
- Are there specific compliance or security standards (PCI, HIPAA, GDPR)?
- What are the scalability expectations in terms of user growth and data volume?
- Which operational metrics and logs are most critical to monitor?

## 4. Data and Storage Requirements
- What types of data are being stored (structured, unstructured, semi-structured)?
- What is the expected data size and growth rate?
- Are there specific data backup or archiving policies?
- How will data be migrated, transformed, or integrated with existing systems?

## 5. Security and Access Control
- What authentication and authorization methods are required?
- How are secrets, keys, and certificates managed?
- Are there any special considerations for encryption at rest and in transit?
- What auditing or logging is needed to meet compliance requirements?

## 6. Deployment and Release Strategy
- How frequently will new releases be deployed?
- What CI/CD tools or processes are in place or preferred?
- Will there be canary or blue-green deployments for risk mitigation?
- How will rollbacks and version control be handled?

## 7. Monitoring and Observability
- Which metrics (CPU, memory, request times) are essential to track?
- What logging and tracing tools will be used to troubleshoot issues?
- How will alerts be configured for critical failures?
- Are synthetic tests or real user monitoring approaches required?

## 8. Cost Considerations
- What is the initial budget for infrastructure and tooling?
- How scalable do costs need to be with changing workloads?
- Are there any hidden costs, such as network data transfer or licensing?
- How will cost monitoring and optimization be performed?

## 9. Risk and Mitigation
- What are the top technical risks (scalability, security, availability)?
- How will each risk be monitored or mitigated?
- Are contingency plans in place for potential vendor lock-in?
- What does the backup and restore strategy look like for potential disasters?

## 10. Timeline and Milestones
- What are the major development phases and deadlines?
- Are there any key integration or partnership milestones?
- How will progress be tracked and measured?
- What dependencies exist between different teams or external vendors?
