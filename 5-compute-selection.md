### 2.2 Serverless (Lambda, Azure Functions, Cloud Functions)
- [Prompt] Is an event-driven architecture suitable or required?
- [Prompt] What are the expected traffic patterns (spiky, constant, unpredictable)?
- [Prompt] Any latency or cold-start constraints?

### 2.3 Classic VMs (EC2, Azure VMs, Compute Engine)
- [Prompt] Are there legacy apps or specialized workloads that need full OS control?
- [Prompt] Are custom configurations or third-party software dependencies a factor?
- [Prompt] Is VM-level isolation a security requirement?

## 3. Scaling Requirements

### 3.1 Automatic Scaling
- [Prompt] What metrics (CPU, memory, queue length) will trigger scaling?
- [Prompt] How quickly must scaling react to load changes?
- [Prompt] Does the application require predictive or scheduled scaling?

### 3.2 Manual Scaling
- [Prompt] Are there scenarios where manual capacity adjustments are preferred?
- [Prompt] Any change management process or regulations that limit auto-scaling?

## 4. OS Base Images

### 4.1 Linux
- [Prompt] Specific distributions preferred (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, Alpine)?
- [Prompt] Any security or compliance requirements for the OS?
- [Prompt] Existing automation or tools (e.g., Chef, Ansible) that favor certain distros?

### 4.2 Windows
- [Prompt] Do applications rely on .NET or Windows-specific services?
- [Prompt] Any specific licensing or support constraints?
- [Prompt] Are there toolchains or existing expertise for Windows?

## 5. Additional Considerations
