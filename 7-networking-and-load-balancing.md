# Networking and Load Balancing Requirements Gathering

## Load Balancers

### Load Balancer Type
- What cloud provider is being used (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
- Which type of load balancer is preferred (ALB, Azure LB, GCLB)?
- Should the load balancer support internal or internet-facing traffic?

### Traffic Routing
- What protocols are required (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP)?
- Is path-based or host-based routing needed?
- Are there sticky sessions or session affinity requirements?

### Health Checks
- What endpoints should be used for health checks?
- What should be the health check interval, timeout, and threshold?

### Security
- What firewall/security group rules need to be applied?
- Should access be restricted to certain IPs or ranges?

## Domain Setup

### Domain Ownership
- Is there an existing domain name?
- Who manages domain registration (Namecheap, Route53, etc.)?

### New Domain
- Will a new domain need to be registered?
- Are there branding or naming constraints?

## SSL Certificates

### Certificate Management
- Will certificates be managed via a cloud service (ACM, Azure, GCP)?
- Are wildcard or multi-domain certificates required?

### Renewal & Automation
- Should SSL renewal be automated?
- Who is responsible for monitoring certificate status?

## DNS Configuration

### DNS Provider
- What DNS service will be used (Route53, Azure DNS, Cloud DNS)?
- Will internal DNS resolution be needed?

### DNS Records
- What record types are required (A, CNAME, TXT)?
- Are there specific TTL or propagation requirements?

### Failover and Routing Policies
- Is DNS-based failover required?
- Are latency-based, geolocation, or weighted routing strategies needed?

## Monitoring & Logging

### Observability
- What tools will be used for monitoring (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, etc.)?
- Are logs needed for load balancer requests and health checks?

### Alerts
- What thresholds or events should trigger alerts?
- Who receives the alerts and via what channel (email, SMS, Slack)?

## Scalability & Availability

### Scaling Requirements
- What is the expected baseline and peak traffic?
- Should the system auto-scale based on load?

### High Availability
- Should the deployment span multiple availability zones or regions?
- What are the recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)?

## Constraints & Dependencies

### External Integrations
- Are there systems that the load balancer must integrate with (WAF, API gateways)?
- Are there network peering or VPN requirements?

### Budget & Timeline
- Are there budget constraints for the solution?
- What is the timeline for implementation?
