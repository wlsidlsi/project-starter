# Performance Testing and Optimization Requirements

## 1. Introduction
### Project Context
- What is the project scope, main objectives, and key performance goals?

### Stakeholders
- Who are the primary stakeholders, decision-makers, and technical leads?

## 2. Load Testing
### Scope of Load Testing
- Which components, modules, or endpoints will be tested for performance?

### Tools
- Which load testing tools are preferred or already in use (e.g., Locust, JMeter)?

### Test Scenarios
- What are the real-world usage patterns, peak load scenarios, and data inputs to simulate?

### Success Criteria and Metrics
- What are the target response times, throughput, and error thresholds?

## 3. Compute Sizing
### Current Environment
- What are the current CPU, RAM, and GPU (if applicable) configurations?

### Scaling Requirements
- How should the system respond under increased load in terms of resource allocation?

### Budget Constraints
- Are there limitations on cloud or hardware budgets that might affect sizing decisions?

## 4. Storage Throughput
### Current Storage Configuration
- Which storage services or technologies are in use (e.g., SSD, HDD, cloud block storage)?

### I/O Requirements
- What are the expected read/write operations per second and latency targets?

### Bottleneck Analysis
- How do you identify existing storage bottlenecks or limitations?

## 5. Caching Strategy
### Layered Caching
- Which caching layers are being considered (application-level, database-level, CDN)?

### Cache Invalidation Policies
- How is data refreshed or invalidated to maintain consistency?

### Performance Impact
- What performance improvements are expected from each caching layer?

## 6. Auto-Scaling Thresholds
### Scaling Policies
- Which metrics will trigger scaling events (CPU, memory, request count, etc.)?

### Scaling Limits
- Are there upper or lower bounds to the number of instances or nodes?

### Monitoring and Alerts
- How are scaling events monitored and who is notified?

## 7. Test Execution and Frequency
### Testing Frequency
- How often will load tests be performed (scheduled vs. on-demand)?

### Duration and Stages
- How long will each load test run (spike, stress, endurance)?

### Resource Allocation
- What resources are allocated for performance testing (infrastructure, time, budget)?

## 8. Reporting and Analysis
### Data Collection
- Which metrics are critical for analysis (response times, error rates, throughput)?

### Visualization Tools
- How will results be presented (dashboards, reports, real-time metrics)?

### Actionable Insights
- What actions will be taken based on performance results?

## 9. Risks and Constraints
### Potential Risks
- Are there known limitations in hardware, software, or third-party dependencies?

### Mitigation Strategies
- How will identified risks be tracked and mitigated?

### Regulatory/Compliance Constraints
- Are there compliance requirements that may impact testing or optimization?

## 10. Next Steps
### Prioritization
- Which optimizations will be prioritized based on their performance impact?

### Implementation Plan
- How will changes be rolled out to production?

### Validation and Continuous Improvement
- How will ongoing performance improvements be tracked and validated?
