# CI/CD High-Level Requirements Gathering Document

## 1. Overview & Objectives
- What are the primary goals of implementing CI/CD?
- Which teams/stakeholders are involved and what are their responsibilities?
- What is the target release frequency?

## 2. Pipeline Services & Environments
- Which CI/CD tool or service will be used (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions)?
- Are there existing CI/CD setups to integrate with or replace?
- What environments (dev, staging, prod) are part of the pipeline?

## 3. Source Code Management
- What version control system is in use?
- What is the branching strategy (e.g., trunk-based, GitFlow)?
- How are commits and pull requests handled in the pipeline?

## 4. Build & Compile Requirements
- What languages and frameworks are used?
- Are build artifacts required (e.g., binaries, Docker images)?
- Is containerization part of the workflow?

## 5. Testing & Validation
- What types of tests are needed (unit, integration, functional)?
- Are linting or formatting checks required?
- What code quality metrics need to be enforced (e.g., coverage thresholds)?

## 6. Security Scans
- What security tools are used (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)?
- What compliance standards must be met?
- How are critical vulnerabilities reported and handled?

## 7. Deployment Strategies
- Which deployment strategy will be used (blue-green, rolling, canary)?

- Is zero-downtime deployment required?

## 8. Infrastructure & Configuration Management
- Are config management tools in use (e.g., Ansible, Puppet)?
- How are secrets and environment variables managed?
- Will infrastructure be managed as code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation)?

## 9. Monitoring & Logging
- What monitoring tools are required (e.g., CloudWatch, Prometheus)?
- How is log data collected and managed?
- Are real-time alerts and dashboards necessary?

## 10. Governance & Compliance

- Are there performance targets for pipeline execution?

## 12. Documentation & Training
- Who is responsible for pipeline documentation?
- Is team training needed for CI/CD tools and practices?
- What is the process for updating documentation?

## 13. Success Metrics & KPIs
- What KPIs will define success (e.g., lead time, change failure rate)?
- How will metrics be collected and visualized?
- How frequently will performance be reviewed?

## 14. Project Timeline & Budget
- What is the expected timeline for implementation?
- What resources and budget are allocated?
- What key milestones or deadlines exist?

## 15. Risk Management & Mitigation
- What are the potential risks and failure scenarios?
- How will failures be handled and communicated?
