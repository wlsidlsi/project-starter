# Observability Stack Requirements Gathering

## 1. Observability Goals
- What business objectives or outcomes should the observability solution support?
- Which systems, applications, or services require the most immediate observability?

## 2. Choice of Monitoring Solution
- Which integrated solutions (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Stackdriver) or external platforms (Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus/Grafana) are under consideration?
- Are there existing vendor or licensing constraints to factor in?

## 3. Logging Requirements
- What types of logs (application logs, system logs, network logs) need to be collected?
- Are there any compliance or data retention requirements for log storage?
- What log formatting or standardization is needed?

## 4. Metrics Requirements
- Which key performance indicators (KPIs) should be tracked?
- What is the desired data granularity and retention period for metrics?
- Do you need support for custom metrics?

## 5. Dashboards
- What views or dashboards are needed for different stakeholders (engineering, operations, executives)?
- How should dashboards be organized (by environment, service, or function)?
- Are there any existing design or standardization guidelines for dashboards?

## 6. Alerting Strategy
- Which events or thresholds warrant alerts (e.g., error rates, CPU usage, response times)?
- Who are the recipients of alerts, and how will they be notified (email, pager, Slack, etc.)?
- Will escalation policies be required for unacknowledged alerts?

## 7. Integration & Automation
- How will logs, metrics, and alerts integrate with CI/CD pipelines or incident management tools?
- Are there any automation or auto-remediation requirements?
- Do you need API access for custom workflows or reporting?

## 8. Security & Access Controls
- What level of access is needed for each team or user role?
- How are log data and metrics protected (encryption, role-based access, etc.)?
- Are there regulatory or compliance frameworks to be considered?

## 9. Scalability & Performance
- How much data volume is expected (log throughput, metrics data points)?
- What is the growth forecast for the environment?
- Do you need multi-region or multi-cloud support?

## 10. Budget & Cost Management
- Are there budget constraints or cost-optimization requirements?
- Which pricing model (pay-per-use, fixed subscription) aligns with business needs?
- Is there a need to forecast or cap monthly spending?

## 11. Migration & Implementation Considerations
- Will this be a new setup or a migration from an existing observability system?
- Are there any legacy systems or data sources that need integration?
- Is a phased rollout preferred, or is a full cutover planned?

## 12. Timeline & Milestones
- What is the expected timeline to implement each stage of the observability solution?
- Which critical milestones or checkpoints must be met?
- Are there external dependencies (other teams, vendors) that might affect scheduling?

## 13. Maintenance & Ongoing Support
- Who will be responsible for day-to-day operations of the observability platform?
- How will updates, patches, and new features be evaluated and deployed?
- What training or documentation is needed for the support teams?

## 14. Risk Assessment
- What are the potential risks or failure points in the proposed observability strategy?
- Are there backup or fallback monitoring solutions if the primary system fails?
- How will disaster recovery or business continuity be addressed?

## 15. Next Steps
- Which stakeholders need to review and approve these requirements?
- What outstanding information or decisions are required to finalize the observability plan?
- Are there any immediate action items or follow-up tasks?
